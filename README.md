Excel-based Corporate Financial Forecasting & Sector Fundamentals Model
Author: Akshat Gupta
Status: Public Portfolio Project
Tools used: Microsoft Excel, Financial Modelling, Ratio Analysis, DCF, Relative Valuation

# Project Overview
This repository contains my Excel-based financial models developed for a deep cross-sector study of 122 Indian and US companies across 11 sectors.
This model covers:
> Historical data analysis (2020–2025)
> Forecasting (2025–2030)
> Sector-level consolidation
> Ratio analysis & efficiency metrics
> Valuations (DCF, multiples, intrinsic vs market comparison)
> Risk-adjusted performance metrics (RAPI)
> Capital efficiency (ROCE, ROE, asset turns)
These models form the analytical backbone of my independent research paper:

> “Decoding India and US Corporate Landscape: Cross-Sector Fundamentals and Outlook to 2030”
(Published on SSRN, November 2025)

# What This Model Includes

1. Company-Level Forecast Models

For each company:
> Revenue forecasting (CAGR method)
> Operating and net profitability projections
> Balance sheet roll-forward schedules
> Working capital models
> Capex–Depreciation forecasting
> Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
> WACC-based valuation

2. Sector-Level consolidated models
Each sector model provides:
> Combined revenue and profit trajectories
> Sector ROCE and reinvestment metrics
> Leverage and capital structure trends
> Forecasted financial indicators (2025-30)
> Sector-level valuation multiples

3. Cross-Market comparative framework
India vs US sector comparison:
> Profitability & Efficiency
